From the previous challenge, [Follow the Money](../Day%2021/01%20-%20Follow%20the%20Money.md), I already had the username `n0trustx`. This lead me to a [Twitter account](https://x.com/n0trustx).

Browsing through the account's feed, I eventually found this [post/picture](https://x.com/N0TrustX/status/1974846974567629253/photo/1):

The sign in the upper right was barely legible: `Building & Design Decoration Center`. The sign post directly in front of the camera also had a fairly unique name on it that read: `Elizabeth Brown Park`. Upon Googling both of these, I determined that the picture was taken in Wytheville, Virginia.

Flag #1: **Wytheville**

The second flag was supposedly "nearby" and the Twitter feed also had this:

I searched for coffee places in Wytheville, VA and eventually found a shop called The Grind:

I sorted the reviews by newest first and carefully went through them, eventually finding this one:

Flag #2: **Flag{this_is_good_java}**
